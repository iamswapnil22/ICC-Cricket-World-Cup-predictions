## Background

The World Cup Winner Prediction 2023 ML project leverages historical World Cup data to train a machine learning model capable of forecasting match outcomes. The project aims to provide insights into team performance and factors influencing success in the tournament.

## Data

The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing information on previous World Cup tournaments, including team statistics, player performances, and match outcomes. The data has been preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables.


To use the project for World Cup winner predictions, follow these steps:

# Installation

**Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iamswapnil22/ICC-Cricket-World-Cup-predictions.git
    ```


# Notebook

The machine learning model has been trained on historical World Cup data using the `WorldCupPrediction.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. Check the notebook for details on the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training process. This includes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
